# Case Triage Agent â€” Technical Documentation

## Overview

The **Case Triage Agent** is an AI-powered solution that automatically assigns Salesforce Cases to the appropriate owner and identifies the case reason based on customer intent. It compares customer-submitted text against a set of configurable **Case Triage Rules**, leveraging the Salesforce core platform (Data Cloud, Apex, Flow, Prompt Builder, Agent Builder).

This solution uses natural language understanding for routing and is designed to be both **scalable** and **dynamic**.
